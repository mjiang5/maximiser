$200 bonus when you open a Premier Checking account in branch
$100 bonus when you open any consumer checking account in branch","Account needs to be kept open for 179 days otherwise the bonus is forfeit a $35 early account closeout fee is charged. If you zero out the account after receiving the bonus they will close it after two weeks and you’ll keep the bonus though according to this comment.This is the easiest account to keep fee free for the $150 bonus. It has a $5 monthly fee, but that is waived as long as you enroll in eStatements.This is the account required for the $250 bonus. It has a $22 monthly fee, this is waived when you do either of the following:I don’t think the $250 bonus is worth considering because it’s much more difficult to keep the account fee, plus you need to go into branch and that’s typically a longer and less convenient way of opening an account. $150 bonus does look worth doing, only requires a recurring direct deposit and keeping the account fee free is extremely easy only requiring eStatements. Previously we’ve seen $250 bonuses that were in branch, but the easier to keep fee free accounts were eligible but they were at select new branches only. Personally I’d be jumping on this if I lived in one of the eligible counties, because of that I’ll add it to our best checking bonuses.

Expiration date: November 30th, 2019","Ocean First Bank is offering a bonus of $250. To receive the bonus you need to complete the following requirements:
Open a new Simply Great Checking account
Request a debit card and receive $50
Make a debit card transaction of $25+ and a mobile deposit of $25 or more within 60 days and receive a $100 bonus
On your 6 month account anniversary receive a $100 bonus","Simply Great checking account comes with a $7.95 monthly maintenance fee. Fee is waived with a daily minimum balance of $5000. Fine print says it’s waived first year.Account needs to be kept open for one year or bonus is forfeit.We saw a similar bonus last October, but it was for $50 less but could be opened online. There was also a $300 bonus the previous year. Don’t think it really makes sense to wait for a better bonus to come along as it seems to be a strict one per year and looks like you might be able to churn them as well (although the accounts do need to be kept open for one year to avoid forfeiting the bonus). The deal itself is worth doing if you live near a branch as no direct deposit is required and the monthly fee is waived the first year. I’ll be adding this to the best checking bonus page.Hat tip to PracticalEmployeeUseful posts regarding bank bonuses:"

I would recommend reading through the old post on the old bonus, as lots of people have had issues getting everything set up correctly. That being said, this bonus has been simplified so I’m hopeful it won’t be too difficult this time.I do think this bonus is worth considering, you get a $250/$500 bonus and the funds can earn 2.15% APY which is just below the best high yield savings accounts with no requirements. That being said it probably doesn’t make sense to transfer across funds just yet as they don’t need to be in there until 11/15 (keep in mind account must be opened by 10/31).

Money market account has a $10 monthly fee, this is waived with a minimum balance of $5,000.There is a $10 fee if the account is closed within 90 days.Credit card bonus isn’t worth considering as it’s only for $25 and will result in a hard pull. The checking bonus is worth doing as the requirements are fairly easy to meet. The money market account earns 0.5% APY on balances of $10,000+. This with the $100 bonus basically means you’d be earning 4.5% APY during the 90 day period, good but not great. Probably not worth it for most people, but will vary based on what high interest accounts you have.

I’d recommend asking if they have hit the account caps ($10 million or 1,400 accounts for personal and $20 million or 800 accounts for business) before opening the account.

They have offered the same bonus before, but last time it was offered it was for $300 and the time before that it was $300 and could be opened online so I guess they are making the bonus progressively worse.

Assuming the above market rate holds into the future, it’s sort of a passive bonus – after the initial setup investment the account will continue to earn without additional churning effort.The cost is managing another account, but with my spreadsheets and process already in place that marginal cost is pretty low for me.  I never closed my Netspend accounts when the maximum investment fell to $1,000; I’m happy to leave them running on auto pilot with scheduled ACHs.Also each person is eligible for their own primary savings account so this might be beneficial if you have for instance multiple family members in the same household:I received no hard credit pull on a recent application (checked credit karma) to only open a primary savings account and was also able to place a $250 deposit on my citi double cash card (posted as a purchase)."
